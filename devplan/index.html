  <h1>Domer Doors Dev Plan</h1>
  <h3>Relational Schema of Database</h3>
  <p>Resident(varchar [8] netID, int year, int pickNum, varchar [50] name, int roomNum, varchar[20] dorm, bool isStaff, bool party, bool study, bool closeToStaff, bool closeToStairs, bool closeToElevator, bool goodView, primary key(netID), foreign key (pickNum) references Pick(pickNum))</p>
  <p>Section(varchar [20] dorm, varchar[10] sectionID, int floor not null, primary key(dorm, sectionID))</p>
  <p>Room(varchar [20] dorm, int roomNum, varchar[10] section not null, int numResidents not null, int floor, bool hasGoodView, bool isOccupied, bool freshmanRoom, bool staffRoom, bool lounge, bool studyRoom, bool bathroom, int sqareFootage, bool closeToStairs, bool closeToElevator, primary key (dorm, roomNum), foreign key (section) references Section(sectionID))</p>
  <p>Pick(int pickNum primary key, varchar [8] netID, varchar [20] dorm, int roomNum, foreign key (roomNum) as Room(roomNum), foreign key (netID) references Resident(netID))</p>
  <h3>Database, Platforms, and Languages</h3>
  <p>The group will be using MySQL, php, HTML/CSS and JavaScript for the project. The version control used will be GitHub.</p>
  <h3>Data Gathering</h3>
  <p>The group will gather data from the university's architect's office and administration office. The data will include floor plans of each dorm, designs of each building, and student netIDs. If no student netIDs are given, the group will ask for voluntary IDs of the students in our halls.</p>
  <h3>Who's Doing What</h3>
  <p>In terms of who will be doing what, the split will be even in the beginning. Each group member will do every task assigned to a dorm in terms of simple queries, basic html, php, etc., so every group member can be comfortable dealing with all aspects of web dev.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ben - Dillion Hall</li>
	<li>Cory - Fisher Hall</li>
	<li>Jack - Carroll Hall</li>
	<li>David - Knott Hall</li>
</ul>
<p>As the project progresses, the split will still be relatively even, however, Jack and David will attempt to help the group implement more advanced UI features. Ben and Cory will be doing more advanced, in-depth query searching. Saying this, all will still be equally involved but with some more advanced features being handled by different members of the group based on experience in a certain field.</p>
  <h3>Project Timeline:</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>October 7 : Have all building schematics from university architect</li>
