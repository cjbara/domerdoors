  <h4>Project Title</h4>
    <p>ND Room Pick System</p>
  <h4>Project Summary</h4>
    <p>For this project, the group will be designing a new room pick system for the dorms on campus. Students will be able to login online and pick the room of their choice during their 45 second window. This should be much more efficient than the traditioanl way of waiting your turn in a long line in the main loby. Students will be able to grab a room from anywhere they have internet access.</p>
    <p>This project is definitely useful because no one has created something like this and an online room pick system is a more efficient than the old, manual system. We will get all data from the university (rosters of dorms, updated campus map, every dorms schematic, etc..).
    <p>Some of the basic functions will include generating random ordering of students within their grade, allowing students to select rooms and roomates, and querying through rooms by type (single, double, triple, quad, 6-man/chick) and floor.</p>
    <p>An advanced function would be querying the database for similar interests such as (noise level, proximity to exits/bathrooms/RA/AR, and outisde views). Another advance feature will be cross confirmation between roomates who want to live in the same room. We believe these features are a good idea because it gives people who do not hang out with a large number of people in the dorm, an idea of what each section will be like based on peoples' activities. We also believe it's a good idea to have roomates confirm they will be rooming with someone as opposed to just adding anyone's name just as a place holder.</p>

    <p>For this diagram we assume we will be able to have all the information needed from the university. We also assume that there will be a certain number of rooms reserved for incoming freshman.
